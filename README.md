_**This assignment is a tutorial on how to create a Github Account with Git, Github, and Webstorm. The objective is to describe the process of how to use Git and Github.**_
<br> **Part 1: Directions on Using Webstorm + Info on Git/Github**
<br> Github is a platform where people can store, manage, code, and share their codes or projects. To set up a github account, go to the github website: https://github.com/, and create an account. To begin coding, you can create a repository and name it. Github keeps track of all the changes that are made to the files. There is a free version of Github and also a paid version with more features. It was created by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds. It also serves as a hub of all your projects, so employers can look through various projects. 

<br> Webstorm is a software application that is used to debug different applications. It is a JavaScript and TypeScript IDE created by JetBrains. To install Webstorm, you can download the application from this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/. You can also connect Webstorm and Github through going through the system preferences in the settings and adding your Github Password to Webstorm. To create a repository on Webstorm, select VCS and import it into the Version control. You can also import a repository from Github by entering the URL of the Github repository path. To create a new project, click "Create New Project" on the main Webstorm page, and then to create a Webstorm file, you choose File --> HTML --> HTML 5 or File --> Stylesheet. You then add files onto Github after commiting changes by clicking VCS, importing to Version Control, and then sharing the project on Github.  

<br> To install Git, you can download the application from this link: https://git-scm.com/downloads. After you download the application, you must set it up by creating an account. 

<br> **Part 2: Glossary**
<br> **1.) Branch** - A branch is contained in a repository but does not affect the main branch, so it allows for a free range of working without disturbing the main version; you can merge the branches together to make new changes 
<br> **2.) Clone** - This is a copy of the repository that stays on the developer's computer; you can edit on the clone while keeping track of the changes through Git
<br> **3.) Commit** - This is a revision that is an individual change of a file or multiple files; when you commit to save something, Git creates an ID that allows you to have the history of the changes you've made; you can also right a commit message 
<br> **4.) Fetch** - This adds change from the remote repository to the local working branch without committing, allowing you to see the changes before committing them 
<br> **5.) GIT** - Git is an open source program for tracking changes in the text files; this is the core technology that Github is built on 
<br> **6.) Github** - Github is an online software development platform that is used for storing, managing, and sharing code or various projects
<br> **7.) Merge** - Merging applies changes from one branch into another and is done through a pull request 
<br> **8.) Merge Conflict** - Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same code or when someone edits a file and another deletes it; it is a difference that occurs between the merged branches 
<br> **9.) Push** - Push means to send the committed changes to a remote repository 
<br> **10.) Pull** - Pull is the request to merge files
<br> **11.) Remote** - This is the version of the repository that is hosted on the server 
<br> **12.) Repository** - This is basically the project's folder that keeps track of all the files and each revision history; it can have multiple collaborators and be private or public
