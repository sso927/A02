**This assignment is a tutorial on how to create a Github Account with Git, Github, and Webstorm. The objective is to describe the process of how to use Git and Github.**
<br> **Part 1: Directions on Using Webstorm**


**Part 2: Glossary**
<br> **1.) Branch** - A branch is contained in a repository but does not affect the main branch, so it allows for a free range of working without disturbing the main version; you can merge the branches together to make new changes 
<br> **2.) Clone** - This is a copy of the repository that stays on the developer's computer; you can edit on the clone while keeping track of the changes through Git
<br> **3.) Commit** - This is a revision that is an individual change of a file or multiple files; when you commit to save something, Git creates an ID that allows you to have the history of the changes you've made; you can also right a commit message 
<br> **4.) Fetch** - This adds change from the remote repository to the local working branch without committing, allowing you to see the changes before committing them 
<br> **5.) GIT** - Git is an open source program for tracking changes in the text files; this is the core technology that Github is built on 
<br> **6.) Github** - Github is an online software development platform that is used for storing, managing, and sharing code or various projects
<br> **7.) Merge** - Merging applies changes from one branch into another and is done through a pull request 
<br> **8.) Merge Conflict** - Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same code or when someone edits a file and another deletes it; it is a difference that occurs between the merged branches 
<br> **9.) Push** - Push means to send the committed changes to a remote repository 
<br> **10.) Pull** - Pull is the request to merge files
<br> **11.) Remote** - This is the version of the repository that is hosted on the server 
<br> **12.) Repository** - This is basically the project's folder that keeps track of all the files and each revision history; it can have multiple collaborators and be private or public
